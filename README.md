PSD to HTML, CSS and JavaScript project with some jQuery code. It's responsive and includes lightbox gallery build with JavaScript. I've used ES6 arrow functions and template strings, so unfortunately it doesn't work on Internet Explorer, but I'm ok with that because I really like to write in ES6 standard :)
