PSD to HTML, CSS and JavaScript project with some jQuery code. It's responsive and includes lightbox gallery built with JavaScript. I've used ES6 arrow functions and template strings, so unfortunately it doesn't work on Internet Explorer (I mean here that "main.js" script won't work on IE but besides this website looks really well on IE10 and above as well), but I'm ok with that because I really like to write in ES6 standard :)
